# About Me

<img src="images/bio-headshot.jpg" alt="my headshot" style="width:46%; float:right; margin:10px">

I recently completed my Master's at Temple in Computatational Data Science. I spent several years working in the Vision, Imaging, and Data Analysis Research (VIDAR) lab advised by Prof. [Richard Souvenir](https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/).

I worked on many [projects](/projects) there, mostly related to [TraffickCam](http://traffickcam.org/about), which prevents human trafficking by applying state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to a unique dataset of hotel room images.

Outside of TraffickCam, I spent a good deal of time reviewing machine learning techniques, primarily through paper reading & self-study of Stanford's [cs231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) coursework. I tutored several other students through the same process, and even incorporated some materials into the undergraduate curriculum at Temple.

Prior to Temple, I worked as a Systems Engineer at Cerner - my first job in DevOps. I worked on the cloud as part of the remote-hosted division. It was a treat learning the intricacies of advanced Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems & ensuring my clients production systems were kept up-to-date with the highest availability.

I've also worked as an independent contractor, mostly on interior/exterior house painting, which is very rewarding work that I still occasionally dabble in. I briefly worked for Prof. [Zia Hydari](https://business.pitt.edu/professors/zia-hydari/) at Pitt to help redesign his course IT Architectures & Platforms (back when it was still new to the curriculum!) right after I finished my bachelor's in Business Information Systems.

In my spare time, I like to tinker with computers & software, as well as play games of all sorts with friends. I also play guitar, drums, bass and other instruments just for fun.
