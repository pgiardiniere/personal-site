# Hey, I'm Pete.

<h4>

Most recently, I was lead developer of TraffickCam, where I overhauled the TraffickCam Search API architecture to make its services more robust & well-defined. I designed, wrote, and published the TraffickCam mobile app to Android and iOS app stores. And I maintained the TraffickCam Search web app, reducing development overhead and greatly increasing documentation coverage.
