# Hey, I'm Pete.

<h4>
I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating performant, maintainable machine learning systems.
<br>
<br>

I specialize in cloud microservice design & AI model deployment, delivering new APIs and models to production with minimal impact.
<br>
I also create UIs which enable deep, insightful AI experiences on web and mobile platforms.

Most recently, I was lead developer of TraffickCam. I overhauled the TraffickCam hotel search engine's microservice architecture to reduce service coupling, improving search result times. I secured the TraffickCam hotel search web app with improved user authentication and fewer dependencies. And I designed, wrote, and published the TraffickCam mobile app to Google Play and the App Store.
