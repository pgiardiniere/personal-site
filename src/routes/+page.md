### Hey I'm Pete. I'm a full stack developer of intelligent systems with a passion for writing performant, maintainable machine learning pipelines.

#### I live in Philly, where I spend most of my time developing software and writing.

I designed, wrote, and published the TraffickCam mobile app to Android and iOS app stores. I maintained the TraffickCam Search webapp and completely rewrote its documentation. And I overhauled the TraffickCam API service architecture to make services more robust and fault tolerant (by placing separate concerns in distinct services and tightly coupling single concerns into a single runtime).
