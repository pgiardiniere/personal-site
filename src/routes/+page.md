Most recently, I was lead developer of TraffickCam. I overhauled the TraffickCam hotel search engine's microservice architecture to reduce service coupling, increasing search performance. I designed, wrote, and published the TraffickCam mobile app to Android and iOS app stores. And I maintained the TraffickCam hotel search web app, reducing development framework overhead and greatly increasing documentation coverage.
