# Hey, I'm Pete.

### I'm a full stack developer with a passion for writing performant, maintainable machine learning pipelines and UIs which enable frictionless human-AI interaction.

#### I live in Philly, where I spend most of my time developing software and writing.

I designed, wrote, and published the TraffickCam mobile app to Android and iOS app stores. I maintained the TraffickCam Search webapp and completely rewrote its documentation. And I overhauled the TraffickCam API architecture to make its services more robust, performant, and developer-friendly.
