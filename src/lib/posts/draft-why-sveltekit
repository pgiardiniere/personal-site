I wanted to get a little deeper on why I chose the stack I did for my personal site, and other bits and pieces of how its served.

## Why Svelte & SvelteKit

I chose these over the main alternative (React with Next.js) basically because React & Next.js never really jived with me. I had to maintain a React web app for over a year, and after all that time still found myself not really able to work effectively in the stack. 

I know I can design efficient and elegant UIs because I had already done so with Flutter to create the TraffickCam mobile app V2, which is published on Google Play and the App Store to this day.

So there was something particular about React that just didn't sit right. When I started learning Next.js, I thought that would address all my issues, and while it did make the experience a lot better, it still wasn't what I would call a great developer experience.

All javascript tooling in my experience is frustrating to work with, and that includes Svelte/Sveltekit, but what stood out to me was how much markedly improved they are over the existing alternatives
