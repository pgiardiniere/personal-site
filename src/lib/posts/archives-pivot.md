## Pivot on past projects

In the final section of [last week's post](/blog/initial-release), I briefly mention porting posts about past projects. This is in reference to the blog system we used in my lab to report project status updates.

Since then, I've been going over the (hundreds) of posts I have from back then. And on further review, a great deal of these posts contain sensitive, internal information. Even among the ones which do not, many are too granular to be worth posting. I should have taken a count upfront and realized porting it all was not feasible or even strictly desirable.

So as a compromise, I will port a few highlights over time and tag them as "archive posts" so it's obvious where they're from.

I'm also filling out the new [projects](/projects) page to give a high-level overview. And now that there's a dedicated projects page, I've updated [about](/about) with all-new content, among other minor changes.
