I wanted to get a little deeper on why I chose the stack I did for my personal site, and other bits and pieces of how its served.

## Why Svelte & SvelteKit

I chose these over the main alternative (React with Next.js) basically because React & Next.js never really jived with me. I maintained a React app for over a year, still felt like I was fighting for every ounce of productivity I could muster.

I was especially frustrated as I had already designed effective and pleasing UIs with Flutter; most notably to create the TraffickCam mobile app (which is available on Google Play & the App Store). I found it so much easier to get over the initial learning curve there.

So there was something particular about React that just didn't sit right. When I started learning Next.js, I thought that would address all my issues, and while it did make the experience a lot better, it still wasn't what I would call a great developer experience.

Javascript tooling in my experience has a steep learning curve (and that includes Svelte/Sveltekit) but what stood out to me was how much markedly improved they are over the existing alternatives
