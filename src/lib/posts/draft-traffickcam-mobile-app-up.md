# TraffickCam Mobile history available now

This has been some time in the making, a post going back and  

## A (brief) timeline

This was my first project working in the lab as a research assistant. It took me several months to get version 2.0 out the door.

Following 2.0 release, there was a period where I mentored a new student, they made changes which culminated in a few new patches I distributed on their behalf.




Much of the work I have from that time may not be published for public consumption, but with some digging I found pieces which contain no sensitive details and really highlight the work done. Find them in the "traffickcam mobile" tag (__link there__), or individually in the list below:
